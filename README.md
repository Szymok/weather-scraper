# Weather and Piracy Warning Data Scraping Project

## Overview
This project aims to scrape data about weather conditions and piracy warnings from various sources across the globe. The collected data will be stored in a structured format for easy analysis and visualization.

## Data Sources
- Weather data will be obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website.
- Piracy warning data will be obtained from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) website.

## Data Scraping
- Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries will be used to scrape data from the NOAA and IMB websites.
- A script will be written to automate the data scraping process and store the collected data in a CSV file.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
- The collected data will be analyzed using Python's `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries to identify patterns and trends.
- Visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps will be created to effectively communicate the findings.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/WeatherPiracyScraping.git
```
2. Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script
```
python main.py
```

## Note
- Make sure to use python3
- Data scraping may take a while depending on the amount of data and the speed of your internet connection.
- Be aware of any legal restriction or compliance issue with scraping data from the website.
